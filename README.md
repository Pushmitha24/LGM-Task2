This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset, aiming to identify key patterns, trends, and insights. 
The analysis will focus on understanding the nature of terrorism incidents across different regions, types of attacks, targets, and impacts in terms of casualties. 
By examining the data, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can inform further research or policy-making. The dataset is sourced from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which contains detailed records of terrorism incidents worldwide.
